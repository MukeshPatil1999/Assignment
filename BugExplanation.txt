bugs: 
1. In remove_data() function, when we remove an element from the linked list, we need to free the memory of removed node to avoid memory leaks.
   we can use free() function to dealocate memory.
2. we can use pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock() calls for thread safety when modifying the list.
